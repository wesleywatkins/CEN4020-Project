This is the one of the ideas I have for how the AI could work.

The AI will be used in 2 parts:

- Game Board Decisions (moving troops, attacking, etc.)

- Fighting (defend, attack, etc.)

C# includes a way to run processes from within a program and read standard output. We can use this to our advantage in order to run the python scripts that will determine the move the AI deems optimal.

In order for this to work, we will have to pass arguments to the python script that represent certain aspects relating to the current state of the game.

For instance, for the fighting AI, we'd call the script like:

python3 <PATH>/fight.py health enemy_health soldiers enemy_soliders

Obviously we'd need more arguments, but this is just an example.

Cons:
- The user must have python3 installed on their system.
- Along with installing python3, we will need to install certain packages used in the python scripts used to create the AI (numpy, tensorflow, etc.)
- There are going to be a ton of arguments depending on how good we want the AI to be.
