This is another idea I had for making the AI work.

The AI will be used in 2 parts:

- Game Board Decisions (moving troops, attacking, etc.)

- Fighting (defend, attack, etc.)

The AI could be set up on a web server and the game could make a GET request to the server sending information about the current state of the game and the API could return the best move based on those set up inputs.

For example:

GET http://888.888.888.888?health=50&enemyhealth=100

^ These links may get long, but we can have a function that generates them. All we will have to do is pass the correct values to the function.

Cons:
- The user would have to be connected to the internet for the game to make use of the AI properly.

Pros:
- Avoids the user having to install python3 and a plethora of python packages in order for the game to run.
- If we plan on adding networking later anyway, then this would be a good decision.
